# Bat-Algorithm-basic-simulation-with-Smart-Grid
This is a very basic code made in Python, with the intention of simulating a SmartGrid with 5 electronic devices, applying the Bat Algorithm in order to optimize the energy consumption of the devices. This code was made for a final project in the Biologically Inspired Artificial Intelligence course at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, UC3M.
